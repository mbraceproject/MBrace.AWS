### Building & Running Tests

Depending on your platform, you can build and run tests running `build.bat` or `build.cmd`. To successfully run unit tests, you need to have credentials set to your default profile in your local credentials store. Alternative, you could set the following environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_REGION="eu-central-1"                   # defaults to eu-central-1
export AWS_CREDENTIAL_STORE_PROFILE=<profile name> # uses "default" if unset
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>         # your account's access key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>     # your account's secret key
```

### Deploying an MBrace.AWS Cluster

There are currently 2 ways to deploy an MBrace.AWS cluster
* Standalone Deployments: Use `MBrace.AWS.StandaloneWorker` to manually deploy a cluster on-premises or a cloud VM.
* Elastic Beanstalk: Use the `MBrace.AWS.WebWorker` implementation to deploy a cluster using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
